## Chapter 01. Garbage Collection

### Introduction to Java Garbage Collector

In many other programming languages, programmers manage the creation and removal of objects to moderate memory usage.

In **Java**, programmers focus on application functionality while the **Garbage Collector (GC)** controls how memory is
used.

The GC automatically frees the memory space consumed by objects which are no longer used. When objects stored in memory
have become **unreachable** for the program, the GC detects them and cleans them up.

GC is at the center of **memory management** for Java applications which helps to avoid the accidental **memory leaks**
and **fragmentation** issues.

**_What is memory management in Java?_**

Memory management is an **automated** process that is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

One responsibility of the JVM is overseeing the **heap**, which is the space where all the objects created by a Java
program are held. The heap is important because it stores information that the application can use to run more
efficiently.

The **Just-In-time (JIT)** Compiler, traditionally located in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is responsible for memory
disposal.

When memory is not relevant or useful to the program, the JIT is responsible for disposing of it. In the JIT, the
garbage collector locates unused objects to clear memory space.

When the garbage collector categorizes objects, objects are placed at different locations in the heap. There are
different storage locations in the heap, where objects are situated based on how long they've remained in the heap.

Objects can be moved into the tenured location after surviving many processes and can eventually become permanent in the
memory.

**_How Does a Java Garbage Collector Work?_**

The whole idea of a managed language – like Java – is that the complexity of such an essential and extensive
implementation as a GC is actually **hidden** for us.

Which means we don't need to care! Because a lot of developers are working hard on the runtime and the language itself,
the vast user base of developers can benefit from all the work that is happening **under the hoods.**

The initial GC in the original JVM was very limited and not working seamlessly, but after all the evolutions, the
current overhead of the GC is way less noticeable.

A GC process can follow different approaches and, in all cases, contains one or more of the following steps:

- **_Mark (= Trace)_**: starting from the application's root, all linked memory blocks that can be reached are
  **Painted**. Imagine this as a tree with branches, where all leaves are colored. When all endpoints of the branches
  are reached, the painted blocks can be considered as **Live,** while the remaining memory blocks that are not painted
  can be considered as **Non-Live.**
- **_Sweep_**: all the **Non-Live** objects are **cleared** from the heap memory.
- **_Compact_**: **Live** memory objects are brought closer together (`defragmentation`, `relocation`) to ensure big
  free memory blocks are available for new objects. Some collectors will have a **second pass** to update the references
  in the application to memory objects to make sure they are pointing to the correct locations in the memory.
- **_Copy_**: this is another method to improve how the memory is used. In this process, all the **Live** objects are
  moved to a **To** space, while the remaining objects in the **From** space can be considered as **Non-Live.**

There are multiple types of GCs depending on which of these approaches they use:

- Mark/Sweep/Compact
- Copy
- Mark/Compact

A few other terms related to how the GC is implemented are essential when we want to understand the GC process better:

- Single versus multiple passes:
    - **Single-pass**: multiple steps are handled in a single run.
    - **Multi-pass**: in a multi-pass, the steps are handled in different passes, one after the other.
- Serial versus Parallel:
    - **Serial**: one GC thread
    - **Parallel**: multiple GC threads
- Stop-The-World versus Concurrent:
    - **Stop-The-World**: the application is stopped while the GC cycle is running.
    - **Concurrent**: the GC is running **next to** the application and has no impact on the application execution.

**Live Set and Allocation Rate**

As described in the different stages, the **live set**, which contains all the objects still in use, is an essential
factor in the behavior of the GC.

If an application has a constant load and behavior, and objects are added and removed from the **live set** steadily,
its size will remain stable.

A growing **live set** can be caused by a **memory leak**.

The `-Xmx` flag defines an application's maximum heap size.

If the size of the **live set** approaches the `-Xmx` size, the JVM lacks free memory to store new objects and perform
the GC. This will decrease the performance.

To keep the size of our server well-dimensioned to run our application, we need to balance the amount of installed
memory and the `-Xmx` value with the actual size of the **live set**.

Over-dimensioning our server is just a waste of money. But to correctly define this dimension, the **allocation rate**
must be considered.

This **allocation rate** is a value based on the amount of memory allocated per time unit, for instance, `MB/sec`.

A high value can indicate that a lot of objects are being created, resulting in the fact that a lot of cleanups will be
needed. This will impact the frequency and/or duration of the GC pauses.

A good guideline for the heap size (`-Xmx`) is `2.5` to `5` times the size of the average **live set**. The higher the
**allocation rate**, the bigger the heap must be for optimal GC.

### Generational Heaps

Another technique used in GC is **generational heaps,** keeping **young** versus **old** objects in different areas of
the heap because:

- Most objects die young
- Few references from older to younger objects exist

Using this hypothesis, the Java heap is separated into two physical areas:

- **Young generation**: this is where new objects are allocated and where objects are stored which are not old enough
  to get promoted. This is typically a smaller set with a lot of garbage objects that is handled quickly by the GC.
  Typically, `Young Generation Stop-The-World` GCs are **single** passes. The young generation is further divided into
  sections known as **Eden** and the **Survivor spaces** to move young objects if they are used for a longer time.
- **Old generation**: objects that live longer are eventually promoted to the old generation. This set is handled less
  frequently by the GC but takes a longer time.

In many cases, the **Old generation** is larger than the **Young generation**, but not always. This depends on the
static working **live set** of the application and how elastic the boundary between the Young and Old generations is.

In region-based generational collectors (`C4` and `G1`), the size of the generations is **fluid** and **elastic**. Most
of the regions could be the **Young generation**, or most could be the **Old generation**.

In collectors like `CMS`, `Parallel`, and `Serial`, the boundary between the two generations was **fixed**, and the
ratio between new and old generation sizes may have to be tuned.

New objects get allocated into the **Eden** space until it fills up. During the GC, **live** objects (reachable objects)
in the **Eden** and **Survivor** space are copied to the other **Survivor** space.

If any objects become **old enough,** they are copied to the **Old generation** (i.e. they are **tenured**).

We can take advantage of the young generation system by focusing on local variables within methods that have a short
lifetime, so the GC can focus on a subset of the heap that can quickly be handled.

### Types of Garbage Collectors

Just like Java-the-language has evolved, the runtime and tools have evolved a lot, and different GCs have been part of
the JRE.
